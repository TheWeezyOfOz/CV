	<h1>Louise Ward</h1>
	<h2>Customer Insight Analyst</h2>
	<p>I've worked in Customer Insight and Data for 5 years now in order to better understand how to present information to people, how to display complex information in a pleasing environment and how to engage people at their level of interest.</p>
<p>However, programming is my passion. In each course or role I've done, I've found myself being drawn into learning new coding languages and techniques. I've found that that's where I really enjoy myself and I think it's time I take the skills I've learned and move into a software and website development role.</p>

	<h3>Programming Experience</h3>
	<ul>
		<li> Data Analysis and Tool Building (R, R Studio, Shiny, SAS Enterprise Guide, SAS Base 9, Python)</li>
		Recently started learning R as part of the SAS replacement activity at British Gas. Similar to previous scripting languages I've used, R was quite simple to pick up and I'm now developing Shiny applications to bring together data from multiple sources and display useful summaries live for quick analysis which can replace the older, more static SAS projects.
		<li> SAS (Enterprise Guide, SAS Base 9)</li>
		I've been using SAS for several years, developing large data manipulation and analysis projects which have set data inputs and outputs and have informed analysis in British Gas since 2015. SAS is also useful for fast ad-hoc analysis of muliple datasets.
		<li> Python (Spyder, IDLE)</li>
		I learned the rudiments of python as the initial plan at British Gas was to move to a python development environment 


		<li> SQL (SSIS, SQL Server Management Studio, SSRS, TSQL)</li>
		SQL formed the core of the Data Administrator role I had in British Gas between 2013 and 2014 and has proved invaluable for fast queries of complex data ever since.
		<li> Dev Ops / File Management (FTP, Putty)</li>
		British Gas utilises both Windows and Unix environments making the basic use of PuTTy vital. The ULTRA server upon which a lot of my undergraduate programming projects took place was also a Unix environment so my familiarity with bash is alittle out of date but I am eager to get back up to speed. 

		<li> Web Development (HTML4, CSS3, JavaScript)</li>
		<li> Academic Simulations (C, IDL, FORTRAN77)</li>
		<li> LaTeX (TeXworks)</li>
		<li> MS Office (VBA, Excel, Access, PowerPoint, Word, Outlook, Vision</li>
		<li> MatLab</li
